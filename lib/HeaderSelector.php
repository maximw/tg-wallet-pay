 * Wallet Pay
 *
 * ### Beta API has been released for first users! We highly appreciate any kind of feedback as it helps us improve our services. Please share your thoughts using this [form](https://forms.gle/TgBB5Dh35i9QvsTf8).    # Changelog |Date|Description of change| |-------------|-----------------------| | 2023/08/08  | Added the new `directPayLink` to `OrderPreview` object. This link format can be used in Telegram Web Apps                    | | 2023/12/15  | Added the new `autoConversionCurrency` to `CreateOrderRequest` object.                                                       |  # Get started **[Wallet Pay](https://pay.wallet.tg/)** is a business platform within [Wallet](https://t.me/wallet) that enables payment transactions between merchants and customers.  Useful links: - [Wallet Pay Business Support](https://t.me/WalletPay_supportbot) is a Telegram bot for reaching out the Wallet Pay Support Team. - [Demo Store Bot](https://t.me/PineAppleDemoWPStoreBot) is a Telegram bot for Wallet Pay functionality introduction. (Attention: all payments are carried out in real assets) - [Merchant Community](https://t.me/+6TReWBEyZxI5Njli) is a Telegram group for sharing an experience and solutions between group members.  To get started please follow the steps below.  ### 1. Log in to the 'Merchant account'  Businesses or developers can get started by following the next steps to create a Partner account with us: 1. Follow the link https://pay.wallet.tg. 2. Click 'Login via Telegram'. 3. Enter your phone number in the popup window 'oauth.telegram.org appears', and click 'Apply'. 4. You will receive a message in Telegram with an authorisation request, click  'Apply'. 5. Click 'Apply' in the popup window  'oauth.telegram.org' in your Web browser.  **We recommend using an account to which the person dealing with the finances has access. For legal entities, it is an authorized representative.**  ### 2. Take a short survey  If you are logging in for the first time, or some additional information is required, Wallet Pay offers you to answer several questions for more details. There are two steps: 1. Questionnaire 2. KYB (Know-Your-Business) or KYC (Know-Your-Customer) checks  Once completed, your application will be reviewed shortly, and you will be notified about the results. If successful, you will see the fee charged by the service, and get access to your account where you can start the integration.  **For legal entities, the form can be filled out only by an authorized representative: a director or an employee with a power of attorney.**  ### 3. Create the first 'Store' Once the 'Survey' is passed successfully, you will be offered to Create your first store.  ### 4. Generate 'API key' After naming the first store you will be offered to set it up: 1. Generate API Key. 2. Copy your API Key and start integration with us.  ### 5. Create an Order Using generated Wallet Pay API proceed the following: 1. Create an Order. 2. Choose the appropriate payment link based on the store implementation and show it to your customer:     - `payLink` for 'Text Telegram Bot'     - `directPayLink` for 'Text Telegram Bot' or [Telegram Web App](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps).      - for [Telegram Web App](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) use `openTelegramLink(url)` function, not `openLink(url[, options])` (unless you want to open the link in browser)     - for 'Text Telegram Bot' use `url` field of regular [Inline Button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton), not MenuButtonWebApp or anything else 3. Check the Order status.  **Only the specified 'customerTelegramUserId' can open a payment page.**  ### 6. Withdraw the funds After the customer confirms the payment, the funds are credited to your Assets and held for 48 hours by default. After this time expires, you can withdraw the funds to the balance of **your [Wallet](https://t.me/wallet) account** you used to log in to Wallet Pay service.  ### 7. Refund For now you can refund from your Wallet account you use to log in to Wallet Pay. But it will be available in your Merchant account in the nearest future.  ### 8. Sign out from the 'Merchant account' To sign out from your account click 'Sign out'. To log in to your account click 'Log in'. If you want to log in under another Telegram account please proceed the following: 1. Go to Telegram and open 'Telegram (Service notification)' dialog. 2. Select 'Terminate session'. 3. Now you can log in using another Telegram account.  # Design Guidelines When integrating your 'Telegram Bot' with the 'Wallet pay API', please make sure that the payment button complies with the following guidelines:  1. The payment button should be named exactly like one of these two:      1. `:purse: Wallet Pay`     2. `:purse: Pay via Wallet`. 2. The payment button is located above the other buttons (if you have others).  Note: `:purse:` is an emoji (see https://emojipedia.org/purse/).  Please see the example in [Demo Store Bot](https://t.me/PineAppleDemoWPStoreBot).  # Use Case 1. The customer initiates the payment process in the merchant's store. 2. Merchant's bot:     1. addresses the POST order;     2. receives the payment link in response;     3. shows the user the payment button. 3. The customer taps the payment button. 4. The merchant's store redirects the customer to the payment link in the Wallet. 5. If the customer uses Wallet for the first time, they agree to:     1. add Wallet to the Attachments menu;     2. allow Wallet to send messages.  6. Wallet:     1. authenticates the customer;     2. checks the balance and displays a form:         1. to confirm the payment (if the balance is sufficient);         2. to top up the balance (if the balance is insufficient).   7. The customer confirms the payment. 8.  Wallet:     1. withdraws the funds from the customer's account and credits them to the partner store's account;     2. redirects the customer back to the partner's specified returnURL;     3. sends a webhook to the merchant.  # Troubleshooting  ## \"Something went wrong\" screen The most common reasons of the \"Something went wrong\" screen when someone opens `payLink` or `directPayLink` are: 1. Opening outside Telegram-bot or 'Telegram Web App' specified in your Store 2. Opening from [Gaming Platform](https://core.telegram.org/bots/games), it's not supported 3. Opening by customer whos `telegramUserId` does not match provided `customerTelegramUserId` field in the Order 4. Opening by customer who've been banned from using Wallet Pay as payer for some reason. Contact our [Wallet Pay Business Support](https://t.me/WalletPay_supportbot) for details 5. Unexpected error on our side. Contact [Wallet Pay Business Support](https://t.me/WalletPay_supportbot) for help  # Authorization The 'API key' must be provided in the HTTP header 'Wpay-Store-Api-Key'.  Example:   ```sh curl -X POST --location 'https://pay.wallet.tg/wpay/store-api/v1/order' \\ --header 'Wpay-Store-Api-Key: YOUR_STORE_API_KEY'\\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{   \"amount\": {     \"amount\": 30.45,     \"currencyCode\": \"TON\"   },   \"externalId\": \"ORD-5023-4E89\",   \"timeoutSeconds\": 10800,   \"description\": \"VPN for 1 month\",   \"returnUrl\": \"https://t.me/wallet\",   \"failReturnUrl\": \"https://t.me/wallet\",   \"customData\": \"client_ref=4E89\" }' ```  # HTTP status codes The table below describes the possible HTTP response codes you can receive when sending an API request. |Code|Description| |-------------|-----------------------| | 200         | OK                    | | 400         | Invalid request       | | 401         | Invalid API key       | | 404         | Not found             | | 429         | Request limit reached | | 500         | Unexpected error      |
